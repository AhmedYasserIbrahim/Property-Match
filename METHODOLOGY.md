# Property Matching System Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines the algorithmic approach and methodology used in the property matching system for connecting customers with suitable properties in Riyadh.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Processing
- **Customer Data Processing**
  - CSV parsing of customer preferences
  - Normalization of location names (Arabic-English mapping)
  - Preference weight calculation based on customer priorities

- **Property Listing Processing**
  - JSON data organization by regions (North, South, East, West)
  - Property feature extraction and standardization
  - Location-based indexing for efficient retrieval

### 2. Matching Algorithm

#### Primary Matching Criteria
1. **Location Matching (40% weight)**
   - District-level matching
   - Proximity to preferred areas
   - Region-based filtering

2. **Price Range (30% weight)**
   - Exact range matching
   - Flexible range matching (±10% tolerance)
   - Budget optimization

3. **Property Specifications (30% weight)**
   - Bedroom count
   - Property type
   - Area requirements
   - Additional features

#### Scoring System
```
Match Score = (Location Score × 0.4) + 
              (Price Score × 0.3) + 
              (Specifications Score × 0.3)

Where:
- Location Score = Exact District Match (1.0) or Nearby District (0.7)
- Price Score = Within Range (1.0) or Within Tolerance (0.8)
- Specifications Score = Average of individual specification matches
```

### 3. Optimization Techniques

#### Caching Strategy
- 5-minute cache duration for frequently accessed data
- Separate caches for:
  - Property listings
  - Customer preferences
  - District mappings

#### Performance Optimizations
- District name translations stored in memory
- Pre-computed location proximity matrices
- Batch processing for multiple matches

## Implementation Details

### District Mapping
```javascript
{
    'tuwaiq': 'طويق',
    'malqa': 'الملقا',
    // ... other districts
}
```

### Matching Process Flow
1. **Input Processing**
   - Validate customer preferences
   - Normalize location names
   - Standardize price ranges

2. **Initial Filtering**
   - Region-based filtering
   - Price range elimination
   - Basic requirements matching

3. **Detailed Matching**
   - Score calculation
   - Property ranking
   - Results sorting

4. **Results Optimization**
   - Remove duplicates
   - Apply preference weights
   - Sort by match score

## Performance Considerations

### Time Complexity
- Initial filtering: O(n) where n = number of properties
- Detailed matching: O(m × k) where:
  - m = filtered properties
  - k = matching criteria

### Space Complexity
- Cache storage: O(p + c) where:
  - p = property listings
  - c = customer data
